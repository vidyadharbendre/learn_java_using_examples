# Understanding the `package` Keyword in Java

## What is the `package` keyword?
The `package` keyword in Java serves as a way to organize classes into different namespaces or groups. It helps in managing and categorizing classes and provides a hierarchical structure to avoid naming conflicts between classes in different libraries or projects.

## Why is it used?
It's used to organize classes into a modular structure, manage code, and prevent naming conflicts by providing a unique namespace.

## Where is it used?
The `package` keyword is used at the beginning of a Java source file to define the package to which the class belongs.

## When to use it?
It should be used when organizing classes and creating a logical structure for better code management in larger projects.

## Who uses it?
Java developers use the `package` keyword to structure and organize their codebase, making it more manageable and maintainable.

## How is it used?
The `package` keyword is used by including the `package` statement at the beginning of a Java source file, followed by the package name.

### Example:
Suppose we have a project with two classes, `MainClass` and `SupportClass`, organized into a package named `mypackage`.

#### SupportClass.java
```java
package mypackage;

public class SupportClass {
    public void displayMessage() {
        System.out.println("This is a support class method.");
    }
}
```
MainClass.java
```java
package mypackage;

public class MainClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SupportClass support = new SupportClass();
        support.displayMessage();
    }
}
```
This example illustrates how the package keyword is used to organize classes into a package and access classes within that package.
