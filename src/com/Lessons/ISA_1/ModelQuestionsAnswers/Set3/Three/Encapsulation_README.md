# Encapsulation in Java

## What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, restricting direct access to certain class members and providing controlled access through methods.

## Why is Encapsulation Used?

Encapsulation helps in:
- **Data Hiding:** Restricting direct access to sensitive data to prevent unwanted modifications.
- **Abstraction:** Exposing only necessary information and hiding implementation details.

## When to Use Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is used when:
- **Security:** Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access or modifications.
- **Modifiability:** Allowing changes to the internal implementation without affecting the external code.

## Where to Implement Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is implemented within Java classes using access modifiers (public, private, protected) to control access to class members.
