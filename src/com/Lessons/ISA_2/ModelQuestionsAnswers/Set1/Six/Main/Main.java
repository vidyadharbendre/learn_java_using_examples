/*
Role of Packages in Code Organization and Modularity:
Packages in Java provide a way to organize classes, interfaces, and
other elements into a modular and hierarchical structure.
They help in avoiding naming conflicts, providing encapsulation, and
improving code readability. Packages contribute to code organization and
modularity by grouping related code together.

Example of Using Packages:
Suppose we have two classes, Car and Driver, which are part of a
transportation system:
 */
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car carRefObj;
        carRefObj = new Car();

        Driver driverRefObj;
        driverRefObj = new Driver();

    }
}

/*
Packages help in avoiding naming clashes, provide a clear structure,
and enhance code maintainability and readability in larger projects.
They contribute to creating modular and organized codebases.
