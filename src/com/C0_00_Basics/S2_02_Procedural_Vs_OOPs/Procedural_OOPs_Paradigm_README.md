# Procedural vs. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is Procedural Programming?
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm centered around procedures or routines where the program is divided into procedures/functions that operate on data. It focuses on procedures and functions manipulating data structures.

## What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that contain both data and methods. It focuses on classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Core Differences between Procedural and OOP:
- **Data and Functions:**
    - Procedural: Functions operate on data structures.
    - OOP: Data and methods are encapsulated within objects.
- **Focus:**
    - Procedural: Emphasizes procedures and functions.
    - OOP: Emphasizes classes, objects, and their interactions.
- **Data Manipulation:**
    - Procedural: Data and functions are separate entities.
    - OOP: Data and functions are encapsulated within objects, promoting data integrity and security.
- **Code Reusability:**
    - Procedural: Limited code reusability; functions operate on specific data structures.
    - OOP: Promotes code reusability through inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Complexity Management:**
    - Procedural: May become complex and difficult to maintain for large systems.
    - OOP: Encourages modular design, reducing complexity and easing maintenance.

## Advantages of OOP over Procedural Programming:
- **Encapsulation:** Data hiding and abstraction enhance security and maintainability.
- **Inheritance:** Allows the creation of new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse.
- **Polymorphism:** Enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enhancing flexibility and extensibility.
- **Modularity:** Encourages modular design, making code more organized and easier to maintain.
- **Real-World Modeling:** Mimics real-world entities and relationships, making problem-solving more intuitive and efficient.

## Coding in OOP to Avoid Limitations of Procedural Languages:
- **Use of Classes and Objects:** Encapsulate data and methods within objects.
- **Inheritance:** Create hierarchies of classes to reuse and extend code.
- **Polymorphism:** Allow objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass/interface.
- **Abstraction:** Hide unnecessary details and expose only necessary functionalities.
- **Design Patterns:** Utilize OOP design patterns for scalable and maintainable solutions.
