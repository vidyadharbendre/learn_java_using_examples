# Understanding Access Modifiers in Java: `private` vs `protected`

## When to Use `private`:
### Usage:
- `private` restricts direct access to class members outside the declaring class.
- It encapsulates data, preventing external interference.

### Inheritance and `private`:
- `private` members are not inherited by subclasses.
- Subclasses cannot access or modify `private` members directly.

### Best Use Cases for `private`:
- Use `private` for internal implementation details.
- It hides implementation specifics and maintains data integrity within a class.

## When to Use `protected`:
### Usage:
- `protected` allows access within the class, subclasses, and the same package.
- It enables controlled access within a class hierarchy.

### Inheritance and `protected`:
- `protected` members are inherited by subclasses.
- Subclasses can access and modify `protected` members.

### Best Use Cases for `protected`:
- Use `protected` when providing controlled access within a class hierarchy.
- It allows for data sharing among related classes and subclasses.

## Inheritance Behavior of Access Modifiers:
### Inherited Access Modifiers:
- `public` and `protected` members are inherited.
- `protected` members enable access within subclasses and the same package.

### Non-Inherited Access Modifiers:
- `private` members are confined to the declaring class.
- They are not accessible or modifiable by subclasses.

Understanding these distinctions aids in designing classes that maintain proper encapsulation, controlled access, and predictable inheritance behavior for class members.
