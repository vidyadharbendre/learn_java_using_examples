# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

## 1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation involves bundling data and methods within a single unit (class), hiding the internal state of an object and providing controlled access. It's achieved through access modifiers like private, public, and protected.

## 2. Abstraction
Abstraction focuses on displaying essential features while hiding implementation details. It allows working with high-level representations, ignoring specific implementation details. Abstract classes and interfaces are used to achieve abstraction.

## 3. Inheritance
Inheritance creates a new class (derived or child class) from an existing class (base or parent class). The child class inherits properties and behaviors from the parent class, promoting code reusability and the creation of class hierarchies.

## 4. Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to be used for entities of different types. There are compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding) polymorphisms.

These four fundamental OOP concepts form the basis of modern object-oriented programming languages, facilitating the creation of efficient, modular, and maintainable software systems.
