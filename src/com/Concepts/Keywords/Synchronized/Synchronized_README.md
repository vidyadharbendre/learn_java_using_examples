# Synchronized Keyword in Java

## What is the synchronized keyword?

In Java, the `synchronized` keyword is used to control access to critical sections of code by allowing only one thread to execute the synchronized block or method at a time. It ensures that multiple threads do not interfere with each other while accessing shared resources, thereby preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.

## Why is synchronized keyword required?

Without synchronization, concurrent access to shared resources in a multi-threaded environment can lead to data inconsistency, unpredictable behavior, and race conditions. The synchronized keyword helps in achieving mutual exclusion and maintaining data integrity by ensuring that only one thread can access the critical section at a time.

## When should we use the synchronized keyword?

The synchronized keyword should be used when multiple threads access shared resources concurrently, and there is a possibility of data corruption or inconsistency due to concurrent modification. It is commonly used in multi-threaded applications where thread safety is crucial, such as in banking systems, database operations, and concurrent data structures.

## Where is the synchronized keyword used?

The synchronized keyword can be applied to methods and blocks in Java. It can be used in classes, interfaces, and anonymous inner classes to synchronize access to critical sections of code, ensuring thread safety across multiple threads accessing shared resources.

## How can we use the synchronized keyword?

### Example 1: Synchronized Method

```java
public class Counter {
    private int count;

    // Synchronized method to increment count
    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    // Other methods...
}
```
### Example 2: Synchronized Block
```java
public class Counter {
    private int count;

    // Synchronized block to increment count
    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    // Other methods...
}

```
## Who benefits from using the synchronized keyword?
Developers working on multi-threaded applications, concurrent systems, or any scenario where multiple threads access shared resources can benefit from using the synchronized keyword. It helps in preventing data corruption, maintaining data consistency, and ensuring thread safety.

### Example 3: Synchronized Keyword in Thread Execution
```java
public class SynchronizedExample {
    public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
        // Synchronized method code
    }

    public void nonSynchronizedMethod() {
        synchronized (this) {
            // Synchronized block code
        }
    }
}
```
## How does the synchronized keyword work internally?
Internally, the synchronized keyword uses locks to provide mutual exclusion and ensure that only one thread can execute the synchronized block or method at a time. When a thread enters a synchronized block or method, it acquires the lock associated with the object or class, allowing it to execute the code. Other threads attempting to access the synchronized block or method will be blocked until the lock is released by the executing thread.

### Example 4: Internal Mechanism of Synchronization
```java
public class SynchronizedExample {
    private int count;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }
}

```

In this example, when a thread calls the increment() method, it acquires the lock associated with the SynchronizedExample object, allowing it to safely increment the count variable. If another thread attempts to call the increment() method concurrently, it will be blocked until the lock is released by the first thread.

## Conclusion
The synchronized keyword is a powerful tool in Java for ensuring thread safety and preventing concurrent access issues in multi-threaded applications. By properly synchronizing critical sections of code, developers can achieve mutual exclusion, maintain data integrity, and create robust and reliable multi-threaded systems.
