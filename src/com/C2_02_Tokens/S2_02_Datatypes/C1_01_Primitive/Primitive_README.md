# Primitive Data Types in Java

## What are Primitive Data Types in Java?
Primitive data types in Java are basic data types that directly store individual values without referencing objects. They hold pure values and have no associated methods. Java has eight primitive data types, representing different types of numeric and non-numeric values.

## Why use Primitive Data Types?
Primitive data types are used to represent simple values with fixed sizes in memory. They are more memory-efficient than non-primitive types and are suitable for storing individual values without additional functionality or methods.

## When to use Primitive Data Types?
Primitive data types are used when dealing with basic, individual values and when memory efficiency is crucial. They're ideal for scenarios where no further division of data or additional methods are required.

## Where are Primitive Data Types used?
Primitive data types are used in various programming contexts within Java, such as variable declarations, arithmetic operations, and situations where direct value manipulation is needed.

## Core Characteristics of Primitive Data Types:
- **Direct Values:** They directly store the actual value in memory.
- **No Methods:** Primitive types do not have associated methods or behaviors.
- **Memory Efficiency:** They have fixed sizes in memory.
- **Immutable:** Primitive values are immutable and cannot be altered directly.
- **Cannot be Further Divided:** Unlike non-primitive types, primitive types cannot be divided into individual elements or manipulated at a lower level.

## Examples of Primitive Data Types in Java:
- **Numeric Types:**
    - **byte:** 8-bit signed integer (-128 to 127)
    - **short:** 16-bit signed integer (-32,768 to 32,767)
    - **int:** 32-bit signed integer (-2^31 to 2^31-1)
    - **long:** 64-bit signed integer (-2^63 to 2^63-1)
    - **float:** 32-bit floating-point number
    - **double:** 64-bit floating-point number
- **Non-Numeric Types:**
    - **char:** 16-bit Unicode character
    - **boolean:** Represents true or false values (1 bit)
