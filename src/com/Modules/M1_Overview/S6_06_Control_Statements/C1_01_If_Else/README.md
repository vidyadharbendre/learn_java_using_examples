# Understanding Control Statements in Java

This README.md file aims to guide you through a sequence of Java programs demonstrating control statements and different programming approaches.

## Programs Sequence:

### 1. Direct Input Check in Main Method - IfElseMain.java:
- **Objective:** Introduce basic control statements (if-else) and user input handling.
- **Description:** A program that directly checks a user-inputted number for positivity or negativity.
- **Merits:**
    - Straightforward and easy to understand.
    - Directly demonstrates conditional statements and user input.
- **Demerits:**
    - Lack of code modularity; the logic is directly in the main method.

### 2. Static Method Approach - IfElseStatic.java:
- **Objective:** Introduce static methods and highlight modularity.
- **Description:** A program utilizing a static method to check if a number is positive or negative.
- **Merits:**
    - Encapsulates logic into a reusable method.
    - Enables calling without object instantiation.
- **Demerits:**
    - Limited flexibility compared to object-oriented approaches.

### 3. Constructor and Method Approach - IfElseConstructor.java:
- **Objective:** Demonstrate classes, objects, constructors, and methods.
- **Description:** A program using a constructor and method to check number positivity.
- **Merits:**
    - Promotes object-oriented principles (encapsulation, reusability).
    - Provides a clear separation of logic within a class.
- **Demerits:**
    - Requires object instantiation for each use.

### 4. Inheritance and Interface Implementation:
- **Objective:** Introduce inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism.
- **Description:** A program showcasing an interface for number checking behavior.
- **Merits:**
    - Promotes code reusability and extensibility.
    - Allows for polymorphic behavior through inheritance.
- **Demerits:**
    - May introduce complexity in understanding inheritance and interfaces initially.
