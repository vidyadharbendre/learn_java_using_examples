# Non-Primitive Data Types in Java

## What are Non-Primitive Data Types in Java?
Non-primitive data types in Java are reference types that don't hold a direct value but instead store a reference (memory address) to an object. They are also called reference types or objects. Unlike primitive data types, non-primitives can be null and have methods associated with them.

## Why use Non-Primitive Data Types?
Non-primitive data types are essential for representing complex data structures and objects in Java. They allow developers to create custom data types by defining classes and interfaces, enabling abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming.

## When to use Non-Primitive Data Types?
Non-primitive data types are used when dealing with more complex data structures, such as collections (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap), classes, objects, and user-defined types. They offer flexibility and functionality beyond primitive types.

## Where are Non-Primitive Data Types used?
Non-primitive data types are extensively used in Java applications, especially in scenarios where there's a need for dynamic memory allocation, working with collections of objects, implementing data structures, or modeling real-world entities.

## Core Characteristics of Non-Primitive Data Types:
- **Reference Types:** They store references to objects rather than holding the actual value.
- **Nullable:** They can be assigned null, indicating no reference.
- **Methods and Behavior:** Non-primitive types can have methods and behaviors defined through classes and interfaces.
- **Memory Management:** Objects are created on the heap and managed by the Java Garbage Collector.

## Examples of Non-Primitive Data Types in Java:
- **Classes:** User-defined reference types created using the 'class' keyword.
- **Interfaces:** Blueprints defining methods and behavior for classes.
- **Arrays:** Objects that can hold a fixed number of elements of the same type.
- **Strings:** Immutable objects representing sequences of characters.
- **Collections:** Classes representing dynamic collections of objects (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap).
