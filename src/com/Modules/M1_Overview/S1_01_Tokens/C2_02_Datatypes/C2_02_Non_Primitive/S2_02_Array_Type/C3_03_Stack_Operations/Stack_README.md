## What is a Stack?
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements can only be added or removed from one end of the stack, known as the top.

## Why Use Stacks?
Stacks are commonly used in various computer science applications due to their simplicity and efficiency. They are particularly useful in situations where elements need to be processed in a specific order, such as function calls in programming languages, backtracking algorithms, and expression evaluation.

## How Stacks Work
When an element is added to a stack (push operation), it is placed on top of the existing elements. Similarly, when an element is removed from a stack (pop operation), the topmost element is removed and returned. Additionally, the stack allows for peeking, which retrieves the topmost element without removing it.

## Stack Operations
Stack operations include:
- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the topmost element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Retrieve the topmost element from the stack without removing it.

## Illustrating Stack Operations with Arrays
Stack operations can be implemented using arrays in Java. Each operation involves manipulating the array elements to simulate the behavior of a stack. Arrays provide a simple and efficient way to implement stacks.

## Hands-On Practice
Try implementing stack operations using arrays in Java by following the provided code examples. Experiment with different scenarios and observe how stacks behave in various situations.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of stack operations with arrays in Java. Understanding stack data structures and their operations is essential for mastering algorithms and data structures in computer science.
