# Wrapper Class in Java

## Definition
A wrapper class is a class that encapsulates, or "wraps," a primitive data type within an object.

## Purpose
Wrapper classes allow primitive data types to be used as objects, enabling them to be utilized in scenarios where objects are required, such as in collections or when using methods that expect objects.

## Example
The `Integer` class is a wrapper class for the `int` primitive data type.
