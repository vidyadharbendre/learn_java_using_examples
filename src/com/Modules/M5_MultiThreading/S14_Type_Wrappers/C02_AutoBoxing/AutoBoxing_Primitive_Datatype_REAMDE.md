# Auto-boxing for Primitive Data Types

Auto-boxing is a feature introduced in Java that allows primitive data types to be automatically converted into their corresponding wrapper classes when needed. This simplifies code by eliminating the need for explicit boxing.

In Java, when a primitive value is assigned to a variable of its corresponding wrapper class type, the compiler automatically performs the boxing operation internally. This process is known as auto-boxing.

Here's an example of auto-boxing for all primitive data types:

- `int`: `Integer boxedInt = intValue;`
- `byte`: `Byte boxedByte = byteValue;`
- `short`: `Short boxedShort = shortValue;`
- `long`: `Long boxedLong = longValue;`
- `float`: `Float boxedFloat = floatValue;`
- `double`: `Double boxedDouble = doubleValue;`
- `char`: `Character boxedChar = charValue;`
- `boolean`: `Boolean boxedBoolean = booleanValue;`
