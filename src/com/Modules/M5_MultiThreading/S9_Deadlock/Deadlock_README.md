# Deadlock

## What is Deadlock?

Deadlock is a common issue in concurrent programming where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource, resulting in a stalemate.

## Why Does Deadlock Occur?

Deadlock occurs when multiple processes or threads hold resources and wait for resources held by other processes or threads, creating a circular dependency that prevents any of the processes from progressing. Deadlock typically arises when the following conditions are met simultaneously:

- Mutual Exclusion: Processes hold resources exclusively, meaning only one process can use a resource at a time.
- Hold and Wait: Processes hold at least one resource and wait for another resource.
- No Preemption: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from the processes holding them.
- Circular Wait: There is a circular chain of two or more processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

## When Does Deadlock Occur?

Deadlock can occur in any concurrent programming environment, including multithreaded applications, distributed systems, and client-server architectures.

## Where Does Deadlock Occur?

Deadlock occurs in situations where two or more processes or threads hold resources and wait for resources held by other processes or threads, creating a circular dependency.

## How Does Deadlock Occur?

Deadlock occurs when multiple processes or threads hold resources and wait for resources held by other processes or threads, creating a circular dependency that prevents any of the processes from progressing.

### Example

Consider a Java program that demonstrates a deadlock scenario with two threads:

#### DeadlockExample.java

```java
