Purpose :
This simple Java program demonstrates the basic structure of a "Hello World" program.
It serves as a starting point for learning Java programming.

Description:
The program consists of a single class named 'helloWorld', which contains the 'main' method.
The 'main' method is the entry point of the program, and it is executed when the program is run.

Inside the 'main' method, a single statement is written to the console using the
'System.out.println()' method.

This statement prints the message "Hello World - Welcome to Java programming" to the console.
The program does not use any external packages, and it provides a clear and
concise example for beginners to understand the basic syntax of a Java program.
