# Difference Between Errors and Exceptions in Java

Errors and exceptions are two distinct types of problems that can occur during the execution of a Java program. This README.md file provides an overview of the differences between errors and exceptions.

## Errors vs. Exceptions

1. **Occurrence:**
    - **Errors:**
        - Caused by critical problems that usually cannot be anticipated or recovered from.
        - Examples include hardware failures, out-of-memory errors, and system crashes.
    - **Exceptions:**
        - Caused by non-critical problems that can be anticipated and possibly recovered from.
        - Examples include arithmetic errors, array index out of bounds, and file not found.

2. **Type:**
    - **Errors:**
        - Represent serious issues that typically result in the termination of the program.
    - **Exceptions:**
        - Represent less critical issues that can be caught and handled, allowing the program to continue its execution.

3. **Handling:**
    - **Errors:**
        - Generally not recoverable. The program usually cannot do much to handle errors gracefully.
        - Often indicates a severe problem that requires fixing at the code or system level.
    - **Exceptions:**
        - Can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from certain issues.
        - Encourages developers to implement robust error-handling strategies.
