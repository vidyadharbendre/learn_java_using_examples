# Java Multithreading: The Thread Class and the Runnable Interface

## Overview

Multithreading is a powerful feature in Java that allows concurrent execution of multiple threads within a program. Understanding the basics of creating and managing threads is essential for developing efficient and responsive applications.

## The Thread Class

### What is the Thread Class?

The `Thread` class in Java is a fundamental part of multithreading. It provides methods to create and control threads in a Java program.

### Why Use the Thread Class?

The `Thread` class allows developers to create and manage threads by extending the class or implementing the `Runnable` interface. It provides methods for thread initialization, starting, pausing, resuming, and stopping.

### When to Use the Thread Class?

The `Thread` class is used when a developer wants to create a new thread by extending the class. This approach is suitable when the thread behavior is closely tied to the class itself.

### Where is the Thread Class Used?

The `Thread` class is used in scenarios where creating a new class for each thread makes sense. For example, when the thread behavior is encapsulated within a specific class.

### Who Benefits from the Thread Class?

Developers working on applications that require explicit control over thread creation, manipulation, and behavior benefit from using the `Thread` class.

### How to Use the Thread Class?

#### Example:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        // Thread logic goes here
        System.out.println("Thread is running...");
    }
}

public class ThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
        myThread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}
```
In this example, MyThread extends the Thread class, and the run method contains the logic to be executed by the thread. The start method initiates the thread execution.

## The Runnable Interface
### What is the Runnable Interface?
The Runnable interface in Java represents a task that can be executed concurrently by multiple threads. It is an alternative way to create threads without extending the Thread class.

### Why Use the Runnable Interface?
Using the Runnable interface separates the thread's behavior from the class, allowing for a more flexible and object-oriented design. It promotes better code organization and reusability.

### When to Use the Runnable Interface?
The Runnable interface is used when a developer wants to decouple thread behavior from the class, providing a more modular and maintainable solution.

### Where is the Runnable Interface Used?
The Runnable interface is commonly used in scenarios where the thread's behavior is not tightly coupled with the class itself. It is often preferred for better code structure.

### Who Benefits from the Runnable Interface?
Developers aiming for a clean and modular design, where thread behavior can be easily swapped or shared among different classes, benefit from implementing the Runnable interface.

### How to Use the Runnable Interface?
Example:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        // Thread logic goes here
        System.out.println("Runnable is running...");
    }
}

public class RunnableExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        thread.start(); // Start the thread
    }
}

```
