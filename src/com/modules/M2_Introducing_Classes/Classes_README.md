# Understanding Classes in Java

## Who Uses Classes?
Classes in Java are utilized by programmers to create objects. Any developer working with Java can define and utilize classes to model real-world entities or abstract concepts.

## What is a Class?
A class in Java serves as a blueprint or template defining the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data (fields) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit.

## When to Use Classes?
Classes are employed whenever there's a need to model entities or concepts in a program. They are foundational in Java and extensively used to create objects with specific attributes and behaviors.

## Where are Classes Defined?
In Java, classes are typically defined in source code files (.java files). These files contain the class definition, including fields, constructors, and methods.

## Why are Classes Important?
Classes facilitate code organization, reusability, and maintainability in Java. They enable the creation of objects that encapsulate data and behaviors, promoting OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## How to Create and Use a Class in Java?

### Example:

```java
// Class declaration
public class Car {
    // Fields (attributes/properties)
    private String make;
    private String model;
    private int year;
    
    // Constructor (to initialize the fields)
    public Car(String make, String model, int year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }
    
    // Method to get car information
    public String getInfo() {
        return year + " " + make + " " + model;
    }
}
```
To use this class
```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the Car class
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022);
        
        // Accessing a method of the Car class
        String carInfo = myCar.getInfo();
        System.out.println("Car Information: " + carInfo);
    }
}

```
