# Understanding Access Modifiers in Java: Polymorphism and Abstraction

## What?
In Java, access modifiers control the visibility of class members (variables or methods) within and outside the class. Understanding how access modifiers relate to polymorphism and abstraction is essential in object-oriented programming.

## Access Modifiers for Polymorphism:
### Polymorphism Overview:
- **Polymorphism** allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.

### Access Modifiers in Polymorphism:
- **Usage:** Polymorphism relies on inheritance and method overriding.
- **Access Modifiers for Methods:**
    - Use `public` access for overridden methods to ensure wider accessibility for polymorphic behavior.
    - The overridden method in a subclass should have the same or wider access compared to the superclass method.

### Access Modifiers for Attributes in Polymorphism:
- **Attributes:** In polymorphism, use `protected` or `private` access modifiers for attributes depending on the scenario.
    - `protected` attributes can be accessed within subclasses, aiding in sharing attributes across related classes.
    - `private` attributes restrict access outside the declaring class, ensuring encapsulation and data integrity.

## Access Modifiers for Abstraction:
### Abstraction Overview:
- **Abstraction** involves hiding complex implementation details and providing a simplified interface.

### Access Modifiers in Abstraction:
- **Usage:** Abstraction is achieved through interfaces or abstract classes.
- **Access Modifiers for Interface Methods:**
    - Interface methods are inherently `public` and should remain `public` in the implementing class.
    - They provide the contract that classes implementing the interface must follow.

### Access Modifiers for Attributes in Abstraction:
- **Attributes:** Use `private` access for attributes within abstract classes or interfaces.
    - `private` attributes encapsulate data, ensuring implementation details are hidden and providing controlled access via methods.

## Core Considerations:
### Polymorphism and Abstraction with Access Modifiers:
- **Polymorphism (Uses `public`, `protected`, `private`):**
    - `public` for method overriding, enabling broader behavior across subclasses.
    - `protected` for attributes shared among related classes.
    - `private` for attributes to maintain encapsulation within classes.

- **Abstraction (Uses `public`, `private`):**
    - `public` for interface methods ensuring conformity across implementing classes.
    - `private` for attributes within interfaces or abstract classes, ensuring encapsulation of implementation details.

Understanding the role of access modifiers in polymorphism and abstraction aids in designing robust and adaptable code, allowing for flexible behavior and simplifying complex systems.
