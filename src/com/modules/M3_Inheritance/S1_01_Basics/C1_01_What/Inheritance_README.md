i# Inheritance in Java

## What is Inheritance?
Inheritance in Java is a key object-oriented programming concept where a class (subclass) inherits attributes and behaviors from another class (base class or superclass). It allows for code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

## Who Uses Inheritance?
Java developers who aim to create a hierarchy of classes, organizing code in a way that promotes reusability and facilitates extending existing functionalities, use inheritance.

## When to Use Inheritance?
Inheritance is utilized when there's a need to create a new class that shares common attributes and methods from an existing class. It's beneficial for building upon existing code structures.

## Where to Implement Inheritance?
In Java, inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword, where a subclass extends a superclass to inherit its properties and behaviors.

## Why Use Inheritance?
1. **Code Reusability:** Inheritance enables the reuse of existing code from a superclass in subclasses.
2. **Hierarchical Organization:** It establishes a hierarchy among classes, making code more organized and easier to maintain.
3. **Promotes Polymorphism:** Subclasses can override methods from the superclass, enabling polymorphic behavior.

## How Does Inheritance Work?
- The superclass (base class) contains common attributes and methods.
- The subclass (derived class) extends the superclass using the `extends` keyword.
- Subclasses inherit properties and behaviors from the superclass and can add their own unique attributes or methods.

## Names for Base Class and Subclass
Here are various terms used interchangeably for base and subclass:
- **Superclass:** Base class, Parent class, Generalized class, Ancestor class
- **Subclass:** Derived class, Child class, Specialized class, Inheriting class
